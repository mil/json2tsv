.Sh CAVEATS
.Bl -item
.It
Characters in object keys such as a dot or brackets are not escaped in the TSV
output, this can change the meaning of the nodename field.
.It
The JSON parser handles all valid JSON.
It also allows some invalid JSON extension: it does not do a complete
validation on numbers and is not strict with unicode input.
See also RFC8259 section 9. Parsers.
.It
The maximum depth of objects or arrays is hard-coded to 64 levels deep.
